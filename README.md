# Citizen Complaints and Engagement System MVP

## 🚀 Updated System Overview

This full-stack web application provides a transparent and efficient way for citizens to submit complaints and track their resolution through government agencies. Built with Next.js (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), and MongoDB (Database).

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system follows a specific user creation and interaction flow:

1.  **Super Admin Creation:** Initially, a super administrator account is created, possessing the highest level of privileges.
2.  **User Registration:** Other users (citizens, prospective district admins, and prospective sector admins) can create their accounts through a registration page.
3.  **Login:** Upon successful registration, users are redirected to the login page to access their accounts.
4.  **Citizen Access:** After logging in, regular users enter the system as citizens with basic functionalities.
5.  **Role Assignment by Super Admin:** The super administrator has the authority to change the role of a registered user to "District Admin."
6.  **Role Assignment by District Admin:** Similarly, a district administrator can change the role of a registered user within their jurisdiction to "Sector Admin."
7.  **Group Creation (District & Sector Admins):**
      * District administrators can create groups specific to their district. When a district group is created, users with the same location (district) will automatically join this group.
      * Sector administrators can create groups specific to their sector. Upon creation, users with the matching location (sector) will automatically join the respective sector group.
8.  **Complaint Submission (Citizens):** Citizens can submit complaints detailing their issues. During submission, they specify their location (sector/district), ensuring the complaint is initially directed to the relevant sector administrator.
9.  **Complaint Routing and Resolution:**
      * Submitted complaints are initially sent to the sector administrator of the citizen's location.
      * If a sector administrator cannot resolve a complaint, they can escalate it to the district administrator for further action.
      * Once a complaint is resolved by either a sector or district administrator, the status of the complaint in the system is updated to "Resolved," and the citizen is notified.
10. **Group Announcements (Admins):** Within the created district and sector groups, only administrators (district and sector respectively) can write announcements for the group members to read.
11. **Group Discussions (Citizens & Admins):** Citizens can initiate discussion threads within their respective location-based groups. Other citizens and administrators within the group can contribute comments to these discussions.
12. **Discussion Resolution (Admins):** District or sector administrators have the ability to mark a discussion thread as "Resolved." Once a discussion is marked as resolved, no further comments can be added.
13. **Feedback Submission (Citizens):** Citizens can also submit general feedback or suggestions about services or other matters.
14. **Feedback Analysis (Admins):** Administrators have access to a dedicated "Feedback Analysis" page where they can view and analyze the submitted feedback.

## 🚀 Updated System Overview

This full-stack web application provides a transparent and efficient way for citizens to submit complaints and track their resolution through government agencies. Built with Next.js (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), and MongoDB (Database).

## 📌 Problem Statement

In many regions, the process of submitting complaints or feedback regarding public services is fragmented, inefficient, and lacks transparency. This can lead to:

  - ✔️ **Delayed responses** → Citizens face long wait times for resolution.
  - ✔️ **Lack of accountability** → There is no clear tracking of submitted complaints.
  - ✔️ **Limited public trust** → People hesitate to report issues due to previous unresolved cases.

This Citizen Complaints and Engagement System is designed to solve these challenges by providing a structured, transparent, and efficient way for citizens to report issues and receive updates.

## 🎯 MVP Goal

The goal of this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to demonstrate the core functionalities of a Citizen Engagement System that enables:

  - ✅ **Easy submission** of complaints or feedback.
  - ✅ **Automated categorization** based on issue type and location (sector/district).
  - ✅ **Efficient routing** to the appropriate government agencies (sector and district admins).
  - ✅ **Transparent tracking** of complaint status for citizens.
  - ✅ **Location-based group communication and announcements.**
  - ✅ **Feedback submission from citizens.**

This MVP is intended to be scalable and adaptable, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

## 🔧 Enhanced Technical Stack

| Component         | Technology Used        |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Frontend        | Next.js (React)        |
| Backend         | Node.js + Express      |
| Database        | MongoDB (NoSQL)        |
| Auth            | JWT + Role-Based Access |
| Real-Time       | Socket.IO (For notifications and potentially group updates) |

## 🔒 Security & Validation

  - ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
      - Citizens cannot resolve complaints.
      - Sector admins cannot resolve complaints from other sectors.
      - District admins only see escalated complaints.
      - Only super admin can assign the "District Admin" role.
      - Only district admins can assign the "Sector Admin" role within their jurisdiction.
      - Only administrators can write group announcements.
      - Only administrators can resolve discussion threads.
  - ✅ **Data Validation**
      - Checks for valid locations (sector/district must exist).
      - Prevents duplicate complaints.
  - ✅ **Real-Time Notifications**
      - Socket.IO alerts when:
          - A new complaint is submitted.
          - A complaint is escalated/resolved.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Flow)

1.  **Initial Setup:** Super Admin is created.
2.  **User Onboarding:** Citizens and potential admins register and log in.
3.  **Role Assignment:** Super Admin assigns "District Admin" roles; District Admins assign "Sector Admin" roles.
4.  **Group Management:** District and Sector Admins create location-based groups; users auto-join based on their location.
5.  **Complaint Handling:** Citizens submit complaints routed to Sector Admins, who can resolve or escalate to District Admins. Resolution updates the complaint status.
6.  **Group Communication:** Admins post announcements; citizens create and comment on discussions. Admins can resolve discussions.
7.  **Feedback:** Citizens submit feedback viewable by Super Admins.
