# Citizen Complaints and Engagement System MVP

## 📌 Problem Statement
In many regions, the process of submitting complaints or feedback regarding public services is fragmented, inefficient, and lacks transparency. This can lead to:
- ✔️ **Delayed responses** → Citizens face long wait times for resolution.
- ✔️ **Lack of accountability** → There is no clear tracking of submitted complaints.
- ✔️ **Limited public trust** → People hesitate to report issues due to previous unresolved cases.

This Citizen Complaints and Engagement System is designed to solve these challenges by providing a structured, transparent, and efficient way for citizens to report issues and receive updates.

## 🎯 MVP Goal
The goal of this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to demonstrate the core functionalities of a Citizen Engagement System that enables:
- ✅ **Easy submission** of complaints or feedback.
- ✅ **Automated categorization** based on issue type and location.
- ✅ **Efficient routing** to the appropriate government agencies.
- ✅ **Transparent tracking** of complaint status for citizens.

This MVP is intended to be scalable and adaptable, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
